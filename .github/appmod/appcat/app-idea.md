problem there are already a lot of to do lists made and we can say that we've fully optimized and exhausted all innovations for it in terms of efficiency and organization whatever. but one thing that we aren't paying mind to is that though they are extremely optimized and easy to use we can't really say that all of them are effective if the user themselves do not do what they put on their list, why? because they can get BORINGGGG.

solution to do list that is gamified. a to do lists that frames their supposedly boring and tedious tasks into something fun and entertaining. that way they can say that their not doing their chores or whatever but instead feel like their progressing daresay leveling up in life. wherein they are incentivized. it is not only a to do list but it can also be a goals app where u can set goals such as quitting vices and there is a timer and u get points per milestone.
